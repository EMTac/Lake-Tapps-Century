# Lake-Tapps-Century

Lake Tapps is a large, complex reservoir 10 miles east of Tacoma, Washington.
Over 120 years, the lake has evolved dramatically due to human intervention. 
This project showcases that change in 3 snapshots, before, during, and long after the completion of the White River Hydroelectric Project.

Users may switch between snapshots using the control at the upper right corner of the map.
Features can be selected within every snapshot to add relevant historical info to the sidebar.
